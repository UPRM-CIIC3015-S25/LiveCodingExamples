import random

# Create an infinite loop that does something inside.
# In order to create an infinite loop, we must pass a condition
# that always evaluates to True. Some examples are:
#
# while 1 == 1:, while 'a' == 'a':, while True, etc.



# Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number.



# Write a function that guesses a random number from 1 to 10,
# with the code telling you how close you are.



# Play a rock-paper-scissors game against the computer.
